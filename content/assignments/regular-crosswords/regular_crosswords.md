In this assignment you will write a program to solve crosswords, like
the crossword above, created by Alex Bellos [@bellos:2020]. But the
crossword entries, given in the table, look strange. Indeed, our
crosswords will be different from traditional crosswords in the entry
definitions: they will be given with *regular expressions*, or
*regexes*.

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are sequences of characters that describe strings.
We use regular expressions when we want to describe a string following
a pattern, instead of a particular string.

For example, if somebody asks you to locate a certain phone number in
a file, you will try to match the given phone number with the contents
of the file. But what if somebody asks to to find all phone numbers in
a file? Similarly, if somebody asks you to find a particular e-mail
address inside a file, you can simply search for it in the file. But
what if you need to find all e-mail addresses that are present in the
file? Or, you may want to find a word, taking into account different
variants of it (or mispellings); say you want to find "neighbor" and
"neighbour". 

With regular expressions we use characters taken from the alphabet
and some other, special characters, in order to describe the strings
that we looking for. So:

* The special character `*` means that the preceding item may appear
  zero or more times. The regular expression `ca*t` describes the
  strings `ct`, `cat`, `caat`, etc.
  
* The special character `+` means that the preceding item may appear
  one or more times. The regular expression `ca+t` describes the
  strings `cat`, `caat`, `caaat`, etc.

* The special character `?` means that the preceding item may appear
  zero or one time. The regular expression `ca?t` describes the
  strings `ct` and `cat`.
  
An item can be a single character, as in our examples, or a group of
characters enclosed in brackets. The regular expression `(ba)+boom`
describes the strings `baboom`, `bababoom`, `babababoom`, etc.

Knowing regular expressions, you can solve the crossword at the
beginning of this assignment, expanding the regular expressions given
under the crossword as needed to cover all squares.


## Solution Method

To solve the crossword, we must use an algorithm that tries all
possible regular expressions until all squares are filled. We cannot
do that in random, as it is infeasible to try all possible strings
that are produced by the regular expressions given. We must adopt a
somewhat more systematic approach, like the one below.

<ol>
  <li>While there are still entries that have not been filled:</li>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>Pick an entry that has not been filled.</li>
    <li>Find the regular expressions that can fill the squares of the
        selected entry.</li>
    <li>For each one of these candidate regular expressions, fill the
        squares of the selected entry and continue recursively from
        step 1.
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

## Requirements

You will write a program called `re_crossword.py`. You may use the
libraries [`string`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html),
[`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html),
[`sre_yield`](https://github.com/google/sre_yield),
[`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html),
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or
[`sys`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) (in particular,
the list `sys.argv`) to handle program arguments.

To solve the crossword you must start with the regular expressions
that you can use to generate the strings that will fill the entries.
To generate the strings you will use the `sre_yield` library. This
library provides the function  `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern)` that
generates all the strings that correspond to the regular expression 
`pattern`. 

Your program will be called as follows:

```bash
python re_crossword.py crossword_file regular_expressions_file
```

The meaning of the program arguments is:

* `crossword_file`: the file that contains the crossword description. 
  
* `regular_expressions_file`: the file that contains the regular
  expressions that you will use on the crossword. 

The format of `crossword_file` will be CSV (Comma Separated Values).
Each line will contain the following fields, which will be separated
by commas:

1. Crossword entry.

2. String representing the entry concents. Every unknown character is
   represented with a period (`.`). 
   
3. One or more number pairs. The first number in a pair corresponds to
   the entry intersecting the current entry. The second number in each
   pair corresponds to the position of the intersecting character in
   the intersecting entry. 
   
For example, the first line of [`laughs.csv`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/laughs.csv)
describes entry 0 of the crossword:

```text
0,......,15,0
```

The entry has six unknown characters (`......`) and intersects entry 15
at position 0.

The last but one line of the same file describes entry 13 of the
crossword:

```text
13,........,4,4,10,3
```

The entry has eight unknown characters (`........`) and intersects
entry 4 at position 4 and entry 10 at position 3.

The entries will be numbered sequentially. Horizontal entries will be
even-numbered and vertical entries will be odd-numbered, as you can
see in the crossword at the start. If a square is the initial
character of two entries, in the displayed crossword the square will
be labelled with both of them, as happens with the square labelled
2/1.

The program output will be a sequence of lines of the form:

```text
X regex word
```

where `Î§` is the number of the entry, `regex` is the regular
expression that fits, and `word` is the result of expanding the
regular expression so that the entry is filled. The output lines will
be sorted in ascending order by the entry number.

### Implementation Notes

* In step 2 of the algorithm that you will develop you must choose an
  entry that has not been filled yet. Choosing the right entry can
  have a very large impact on the number of steps that will be carried
  out and the overall speed of your program. A sensible strategy is to
  choose the entry with the greatest ratio of known letters over the
  entry lenght.

* The function `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern)` can, depending on the
  regular expression, return a very large number of strings. To keep
  this number in check we can use the parameter `max_count`. For the
  purposes of this assignment, `max_count=5`, that is,
  `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern, max_count=5)`, should be enough.

* If the regular expression contains the special character `.`, then
  the `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern)` functions will try all possible
  characters at that position. In our crosswords, however, we will
  only use upper case latin characters. To avoid trying characters
  that will never occur in the crossword, you should use the parameter
  `charset`, giving `charset=string.ascii_uppercase`. Together with
  the previous point, the call should be
  `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern, max_count=5,
  charset=string.ascii_uppercase)`.

* The `sre_yield.AllStrings(pattern)` function may return the same
  string more than once, so you must ensure that you use each string
  once only.
  

### Examples

_Example 1_

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python re_crossword.py laughs.csv laughs.txt
```

then the program will read the file
[`laughs.csv`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/laughs.csv),
which describes the crossword at the start of this assignment, and the
file
[`laughs.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/laughs.txt),
which describes the regular expressions. It will display the following
results:

```text
0 HAHA* HAHAAA
1 HE(HE)+ HEHEHE
2 (HO)+ HOHO
3 HA+ HAA
4 TE(HE+)+ TEHEHEHE
5 LO+L LOOL
6 L(OL)+ LOLOLOL
7 LULZ LULZ
8 K(EK)*E KEKE
9 ROT?FL ROTFL
10 MWA(HA)+ MWAHA
11 LAW*L LAWL
12 H(EH)+ HEH
13 (HAR+)+ HARRHARR
14 (JA)+ JAJAJAJAJA
15 (AH)+A+ AHAHA
```

_Example 2_

<img src="{attach}films.png" width="700">

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python re_crossword.py films.csv films.txt
```

then the program will read the file 
[`films.csv`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/films.csv), 
which describes the crossword, and the file
[`films.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/films.txt),
which describes the regular expressions, and will show the following output:

```text
0 (M?ON)+CLE MONONCLE
1 SIDEWAYS SIDEWAYS
2 (((OU)|(GE))T)+ GETOUT
3 MO+D([FL]O[RV])+E MOODFORLOVE
4 (MAD?)+X MADMAX
5 ([BM]A[NT])+ BATMAN
6 S([TW]AR)+S STARWARS
7 SH(IN)+G SHINING
8 ([BL](AN?D))+S BADLANDS
9 S((EN)|(EV))+ SEVEN
10 S((EN)|(EV))+THSEAL SEVENTHSEAL
11 CA((S|BL|NC)A)+ CASABLANCA
12 ([CG]A[LR]I)+ CALIGARI
13 ([KB](ILL))+ KILLBILL
14 (SHA[WN])+K SHAWSHANK
15 (K[IO]NG)+ KINGKONG
16 (S?TOR?Y)+ TOYSTORY
```

_Example 3_

Our crosswords may be a bit unconventional, if we allow each entry
position to intersect with *two* others, so instead of squares we will
have hexagons, as in the following:

<img src="{attach}hex.png" width="700">

In this crossword we do not have only across and down entries, we have
a dimension $x$, whose values are the numbers whose modulo with 3 is
0, a dimension $y$, whose values are the numbers whose modulo with 3
is 1, and a dimension $z$, whose modulo with 3 is 2. If that seems
strange to you, note that this is the same rule we used previously,
where the entries were numbered modulo 2.

If you invoke the program with:

```bash
python re_crossword.py hex.csv hex.txt
```

then the program will read the crossword description file 
[`hex.csv`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/hex.csv)
and the regular expressions file
[`hex.txt`](https://louridas.github.io/rwa/assignments/regular-crosswords/hex.txt)
and should produce the following output:

```text
0 HE|HA|OH HE
1 NP|HX|SP HX
2 FN|EG|GN EG
3 .?[SAX][GAS].? XAG
4 .?[FAT][HOT].? EAO
5 .?[AND][NOT].? HAN
6 NO|ON|AT ON
7 XO|GN|PO GN
8 RO|GN|XO XO
```

## Notes

It is possible that more than one solution exists for a given
crossword; if your program produces a different answer than the ones
above but still fills all the entries, it is of course correct. 

Regular expressions were introduced in the 1950s by the American
mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene [@kleene:1951]. Their widespread
adoption in Computer Science began in 1968 when they were used for
searching in a text editor [@thompson:1968] and lexical analysis in a
compiler [@johnson:1968]. Regular expressions then became part of many
tools available in the Unix operating system.

Regexes are a staple of data processing; there is plenty of material
available online to learn how to use them and the [Wikipedia Regular
expression article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
is a good place to start. It is extremely unlikely that you will not
benefit from getting acquainted with them, even if you only have to
process data sporadically.
